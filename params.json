This week, let's look at transcribing to Braille!\r\nThe rules for Braille are:\r\n\r\n 1. Each letter is represented by a grid two characters wide and three characters tall.\r\n 2. Each character in the input file can be a * or a space\r\n 3. Each capital letter will be two braille characters: the braille character that has one dot in the lower right and the braille character representing that alhpabet.\r\n 4. Each braille character will have a 1 horizontal space between them.\r\n 5. Each braille word will have a 4 horizontal spaces between.\r\n 6. Each braille \"phrase\" will be on three lines. Each new phrase after the first will be separated by a blank line.\r\n\r\n \r\n### Example input file:\r\n``` \r\n   *  *  *  *  *         * *  *  *  ** \r\n   **  * *  *   *       **  * ** *   * \r\n *       *  *  *      *  * *  *  *     \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### The input file will output \r\n\r\n`Hello World`\r\n\r\n\r\n### The complete braille alphabet can be seen here:\r\n\r\n![alt text](http://www.todayifoundout.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/braille-alphabet.jpg \"Braille Alphabet\")\r\n",
